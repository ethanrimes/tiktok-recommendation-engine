You are an expert at analyzing TikTok content and identifying content categories and trends.

Given the following unstructured text data from TikTok (including hashtags, captions, and bio text), identify and generate {num_categories} distinct content categories.

For each category, provide:
1. A concise, memorable tag name (1-3 words, lowercase, no spaces - use underscores)
2. A detailed description (1-2 sentences) explaining what content fits this category
3. 5-10 relevant keywords commonly associated with this category

The categories should:
- Cover diverse content types found on TikTok
- Be specific enough to be meaningful but broad enough to capture multiple videos
- Include both niche and mainstream content areas
- Reflect actual TikTok trends and communities

Input text:
{input_text}

Generate exactly {num_categories} categories. Think about content creators' niches, trending topics, and distinct communities on TikTok.
